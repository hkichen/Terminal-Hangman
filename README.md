# Terminal-Hangman
a hangman game you can play in your terminal/console

# Description 
This version of hangman is built using node.js and is meant to run in your console. Simply load the game file (node index.js) to start the game. Follow the prompts and good luck!

# Instructions
Copy and download the repository. You will need to make a JSON package and install npm inquirer before running the index.js file; Once that is done, you can run the game using "node index.js" in your terminal.

# Packages
- npm Inquirer

#Problemshooting
The game works for one round, but it currently does not take in any command to start a new game without having to rerun "node index.js"; This will be a fix coming in the near future.
